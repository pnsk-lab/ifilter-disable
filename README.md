# DigitalArts@Cloud disabler

A tool to disable the DigitalArts@Cloud ifilter (internet filter) by repeatedly terminating its process and reregistering it. 

This tool protects your privacy and freedom by preventing unwanted internet filtering from schools, which want to control you and limit your behaviour using heavy-handed and violent measures.

## Installation

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/pnsk-lab/ifilter-disable/releases) page and download the latest release for your system. Next, run the downloaded executable (`ifilter-disable.exe`).

## Usage

Just run the `ifilter-disable.exe` file. You may get a warning from Windows Defender. If so, you have to allow it to run.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to [k-kozika](https://github.com/k-kozika) and [skikozou](https://github.com/skikozou), who helped me with reverse engineering the DigitalArts@Cloud.
